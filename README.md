# Real Estate Data Analysis Web App using Streamlit
This is a Streamlit web app that provides an exploratory data analysis on real estate data. The app loads data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, and provides several visualizations for data exploration. The app also allows users to select states and compare data between the selected states.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries:

* streamlit
* pandas
* plotly
* sklearn
